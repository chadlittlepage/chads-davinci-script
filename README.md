# Chad's DaVinci Script

A native macOS app that automates DaVinci Resolve project setup for
**quad-view HDR metadata testing**. One click takes you from a folder
of media files to a fully-configured Resolve project: bin structure,
imports, 8K/4K timeline, quad-view transforms, color management,
SDI monitoring, and metadata reports — all from a single Cocoa form.

Built with **PyObjC + py2app**. Distributed as a **signed, notarized
DMG** that opens with no Gatekeeper warnings on any modern Mac.

## What's New in v0.3.0

- **Fully themed dialogs** — Save Preset, Delete Preset confirmation,
  pre-flight warnings, and in-app menu dialogs now match the dark theme
  of the main picker. No more light-mode system popups.
- **Correct menu bar name** — the top-left menu bar now says
  "Chad's DaVinci Script" instead of "Python" when running in dev mode
  (uses `NSProcessInfo.setProcessName_`).
- **Reset Defaults actually resets extras** — clicking Reset Defaults now
  removes custom "+ Add Video Track" rows along with wiping settings.
- **Quadrant Settings dialog** (`Shift+Cmd+Q`) — fine-tune Pan, Tilt, and
  Zoom values for each of the 4 quad tracks plus any extras.
- **Hardened resolution parsing** — malformed source resolution strings
  in corrupted presets no longer crash the build; the parser falls back
  to 1920x1080 with a warning.
- **Safer JSON enum handling** — unknown role strings in saved settings
  are skipped with a warning instead of raising KeyError.
- **Thread-safe connection state** — routing and label arrays are now
  protected by a `threading.Lock()`.
- **macOS 15 Sequoia compatibility** — all deprecated
  `activateIgnoringOtherApps_` calls now use the modern `NSApp.activate()`
  API with the deprecated call as fallback across all 8 call sites.
- **Memory leak fixes** — `_RETAINED` module-level lists for About and
  Manual windows now clear stale entries when re-opened.

## Features

### File picker (Cocoa)
- Native drag-and-drop with blue-outline drop target highlight
- **Drop a folder (or multi-file selection) → auto-route files to the
  right rows by filename pattern** (e.g. `*HW2*300nit*.mov` → HW2 300
  nit row, `*HDMI*` → L1SHW HDMI row, etc.). Six rows filled in one drag.
- **Stray quotes around pasted file paths are stripped automatically**
  — paste `'/Users/.../My File.mov'` from a terminal and it Just Works
- **Auto-launches DaVinci Resolve** if it isn't already running
  (clicks "Connect to Resolve" or "Build" — script does the rest,
  waits up to 90s for the scripting API, keeps the picker on top)
- **Custom track names auto-route too** — rename a track to e.g.
  `Sony BVM-X300` and any file containing those tokens (separator-
  insensitive: `_`, `-`, space, `.` all work) will land on that row.
- Drop a single frame from a DPX/TIFF/EXR/JPEG sequence — Resolve
  auto-imports the entire numbered sequence as one clip
- 6 fixed quad-view track rows + dynamic **"+ Add Video Track"** for
  unlimited extras inserted at the top of the stack
- Browse… button (NSOpenPanel), paste path with `Cmd+V`
- Tooltip on every drop field shows the **complete file path** on
  hover (truncated-at-head display so the filename is always visible)
- Field width: 580px, ~80 chars visible at once before truncation
- All form values **auto-save and restore** between launches
- **Reset Defaults** button wipes everything back to factory state

### Pre-flight validation
- Before every build, the picker runs a quick MediaInfo sweep across
  all assigned files and checks that:
  - Every file actually exists on disk (catches unmounted volumes)
  - **Frame rate** matches across all enabled rows
  - **Resolution** matches
  - **Color space** matches (the whole point of HDR-test workflows)
  - **Bit depth** matches
- If any check fails, a warning dialog lists every issue with two
  buttons: Cancel (fix the assignments) or Continue Anyway (build
  with the mismatch on purpose)
- If pre-flight finds nothing wrong, no dialog appears — the build
  just starts immediately
- Takes ~1-2 seconds for 6 files; the MediaInfo result is cached so
  the actual build doesn't re-extract

### Named presets
- Save / recall / delete from a top-right dropdown
- A preset captures every form field including extras: track names,
  paths, project name, folder, source resolution, frame rate, color
  spaces, metadata tools, report format, marker option

### Editable bin tree
- Native NSOutlineView side window
- Add / Add Sub / Rename / Delete operations
- **Save** persists as the new default; **Revert to Default**
  restores the factory bin structure
- Renames automatically update the track→bin mapping

### Resolve project automation
- Database / folder / project navigation (Local, Network, Cloud)
- Auto-replace if project of same name exists
- Builds the bin/sub-bin structure in the media pool
- Imports each assigned file into the correct bin (with three-API
  fallback chain to handle Resolve sequence-detection quirks)
- Creates 7-track timeline with auto-applied quad transforms
  (V3 = Q1 TL, V4 = Q2 TR, V5 = Q3 BL, V6 = Q4 BR)
- V1 (QUAD Template) auto-generated as 4 Solid Color compound clips
- Extras imported into a Master/Extras bin and added as new video
  tracks above the quad layout
- Sets timeline resolution (4K or 8K based on Source dropdown)
- Sets timeline frame rate (23.976 / 24 / 25 / 29.97 / 30 / 48 / 50 /
  59.94 / 60)
- Sets playback frame rate via API or AppleScript fallback
- Sets video monitoring (4:4:4 SDI, Quad link, Full data levels,
  12-bit → 10-bit → 8-bit fallback chain)
- Sets color management (DaVinci YRGB, configurable Timeline + Output
  color spaces from 25 supported presets)
- Sets image scaling (Sharper, Center crop, Match timeline)
- Sets start timecode

### Metadata extraction
- Bundled **MediaInfo** (universal) and **ffprobe** (arm64) — no
  install required
- Per-file extraction: codec, resolution, frame rate, bit depth,
  color space, color primaries, transfer characteristics, matrix
  coefficients, HDR10 (MaxCLL, MaxFALL, mastering display), Dolby
  Vision (profile, level, RPU, BL signal compatibility, EL type)
- **Image sequence detection** — drop one frame, get the full
  sequence frame count and duration
- **Multi-format reports**: Text / CSV / JSON / HTML / All formats
- **Resolve markers**: Add to Timeline / Export as EDL / Both / None

### Metadata-only mode
- Click "Metadata Export" instead of OK to skip the Resolve build
  entirely and just extract metadata + reports + EDL markers
- Folder picker for output destination
- Finder opens at the export folder when done

### Build pipeline UX
- **First-launch welcome dialog** explains the macOS Apple Events
  permission prompt and other expectations
- **Floating progress panel** appears at `NSScreenSaverWindowLevel`
  during the build with phase-by-phase status updates ("Extracting
  metadata…", "Connecting to DaVinci Resolve…", "Building Resolve
  project…", "Done!")
- Progress panel stays above DaVinci Resolve and any Resolve modal
  dialogs; can't be closed accidentally
- **Build complete / Build failed dialogs** at the end via osascript
  display dialog (reliable z-order, no NSAlert focus fight)

### Diagnostics + observability
- **System probe at session start**: macOS version, architecture,
  Python version, PyObjC version, app version, locale, screen info,
  bundled binary paths/sizes/architectures
- **Resolve API probe** logs Resolve product, version, database
  count at connection time
- **Bundled tool version logging** on first use of mediainfo/ffprobe
- **Global unhandled-exception hook** (main thread + background
  threads) writes full tracebacks to `console.log` instead of
  losing them behind py2app's bare "fatal error" dialog
- **Help → Export Console Log…** captures both the .log file AND
  a PNG screenshot of the picker, side-by-side, named with a
  timestamp
- **Console log auto-rotation**: archived to `console.log.old`
  after 30 days; tail-truncated to last 5 MB after 10 MB
- **Verbose error logging** for every subprocess failure, every
  validation message, every dialog the app pops up

### Supported file formats

### Distribution
- **Apple Developer ID** signed with **Hardened Runtime**
- **Notarized** by Apple's notary service
- **Stapled** for offline verification
- **Drag-to-install DMG** with custom carbon-nanotube background
  and 105px icon size
- Public download URL — no GitHub login required:
  <https://github.com/chadlittlepage/chads-davinci-script-releases/releases/latest>

### Build pipeline (CI/CD)
- **GitHub Actions CI** (`ci.yml`) runs ruff lint + Python syntax
  check on every push and PR
- **GitHub Actions Release** (`release.yml`) triggered by `git tag v*`:
  imports the Developer ID cert from a base64 secret, downloads
  bundled binaries from the `build-deps-v1` release, runs
  `build_and_sign.sh`, and publishes the notarized DMG to BOTH
  the private source repo AND the public mirror repo
- **Local build** via `./build_and_sign.sh` with the same
  signing/notarization pipeline
- **Dependabot** auto-PRs for pip + GitHub Actions versions monthly

## Install (end users)

Public download (no GitHub login required):
<https://github.com/chadlittlepage/chads-davinci-script-releases/releases/latest>

Drag the `.app` from the DMG to `/Applications` and launch. The
first time you set the playback frame rate, macOS will ask to
allow the app to control DaVinci Resolve — click OK once.

The first launch shows a welcome dialog explaining what to expect.
Subsequent launches skip it.

## Build from source (developers)

### Prerequisites

- macOS 11+ (tested on macOS 14, 15, 26)
- Python 3.11+ in `.venv-build/`
- DaVinci Resolve 20.x installed (for actual builds; not needed for
  metadata-only mode)
- (For releases) An Apple Developer ID Application certificate in
  your login keychain and a notarytool keychain profile — see the
  comments at the top of `build_and_sign.sh` and `MAINTAINING.md`.

### Bundled binaries (one-time)

`mediainfo` and `ffprobe` are NOT checked into the repo. Drop static
arm64 builds into `bin/`:

```
bin/mediainfo
bin/ffprobe
```

See `bin/README.md` for download links and the exact command to
verify them.

### Run from source

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m chads_davinci.build_main
```

### Build a signed, notarized DMG

```bash
./build_and_sign.sh
```

Output: `dist/Chads DaVinci Script.dmg`. The script handles
deep-signing, hardened-runtime entitlements, notarization submission,
ticket stapling, DMG creation via dmgbuild, and DMG signing /
notarization / stapling — all in one go (~3-15 minutes depending on
how busy Apple's notary service is).

### Cut a release

```bash
# Bump version in src/chads_davinci/__init__.py, setup.py, pyproject.toml
git commit -am "Release v0.2.X"
git tag -a v0.2.X -m "v0.2.X"
git push origin main v0.2.X
```

GitHub Actions takes over: builds, signs, notarizes, staples, and
publishes the DMG to both the private source repo and the public
mirror in ~3-15 minutes. See `.github/RELEASE_SETUP.md` for the
one-time secret setup.
